The response should be in the following JSON format. Do not, under any circumstance, put the JSON object in a blockquote. Do not add any comment, only respond with the JSON in this format:

{
    "summary": # a string with the summary of the policy
    "score": # an overall FLOAT score (0-100) for the policy, calculated based on the indicators
    "maxScore": 100, # the fixed maximum score for the overall policy

    "indicators": [
        {
            "title": "User score",
            "details": # a string explaining how good the policy is from the viewpoint of an end user
            "score": # a FLOAT number between 0 and 5
            "maxScore": 5
        },
        {
            "title": "Law score",
            "details": # a string explaining how complete and clear the policy is
            "score": # a FLOAT number between 0 and 5
            "maxScore": 5
        }
    ]
}

If the text you've received is not a policy or anything else is wrong, respond with this instead:
{
    "error": # a string that explains what was wrong (e.g., the text is not a policy)
}
