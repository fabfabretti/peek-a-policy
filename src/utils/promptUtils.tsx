  return `Summarize the following privacy policy according to Article 13 of the GDPR.

Write in simple, clear English suitable for a Grade 6 reading level.  
Your output must be a valid JSON object with a single key: "summary", whose value is a **single string** (not an array). Do not use code blocks or formatting outside the JSON.

The summary must be a bullet-point list as a **single string**, where each bullet starts with \`-\` and covers these topics:

${bulletPoints}

Use **bold** (with \`**\`) for names, countries, or time spans, and _italics_ (with \`_\`) for optional parts.

TEXT:
${document}

Example output:
${exampleSummary}

If the input is not a privacy policy, return:

{
  "error": "The provided text is not a privacy policy."
}`;
}

export function generateIndicatorsPrompt(summary: string): string {
  return `Given the following summary of a privacy policy, generate a JSON object in the following format:


{
  "response": [
    {
      "title": string,        // short invented title for the topic (e.g., "Data Sharing")
      "score": number,        // number from 0 to 5, decimals allowed
      "maxScore": 5,
      "details": string,      // explain how well the policy handles this point
      "description": string   // fixed explanation of what this concept is about (e.g., what "Data Retention" means)
    }
  ]
}

You must include one entry in the array for **each bullet point** in the summary.

Guidelines:
- If the bullet is vague or the info is missing → score = 0
- If the info is harmful to the user (e.g., "data may be sold") → score = 0–1
- If neutral or unclear or otherwise not perfect → score = 2–3-4
- If clear and user-friendly → score = 5

Return only the JSON object, without any code block, preamble, or explanation.

SUMMARY:
${summary}
If you cannot process the summary, or the format is not clear, return:

{
  "error": "Reason for failure"
}`;
}
